# Sale_Price_prediction
This project was part of a hackathon organised by dockship.io .This problem statement contains 3 csv file consisting of train, test, store. 
I made 3 ipynb files, one of which has store.csv file merged with train and test as i wnated to extract out some additional info and then create required model.
Other two ipynb files contains only train ,test csv with deep learning models and simple Machine learning model.
In this project I have provided both one hot Encoding and LabelEncoding. One can choose among these two according to their wish.
